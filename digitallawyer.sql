(3, 424, '7', 'Understanding the GST – Goods and Service Tax', 'What is GST? How does it work?\nGST is a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer to the consumer. Credits of input taxes paid at each stage will be available in the subsequent stage of value addition, which makes GST essentially a tax only on value addition at each stage. The final consumer will thus bear only the GST charged by the last dealer in the supply chain, with set-off benefits at all the previous stages.\n \nWhich taxes at the Centre and State level are being subsumed into GST?\nAt the Central level, the following taxes are being subsumed:\n\n    Central Excise Duty,\n    Additional Excise Duty,\n    Service Tax,\n    Additional Customs Duty commonly known as Countervailing\n    Duty, and\n    Special Additional Duty of Customs.\n\nAt the State level, the following taxes are being subsumed:\n\n    Subsuming of State Value Added Tax/Sales Tax,\n    Entertainment Tax (other than the tax levied by the local bodies),\n    Central Sales Tax (levied by the Centre and collected by the\n    States),\n    Octroi and Entry tax,\n    Purchase Tax,\n\n\nHow would GST be administered in India?\nKeeping in mind the federal structure of India, there will be two components of GST – Central GST (CGST) and State GST (SGST). Both Centre and States will simultaneously levy GST across the value chain. Tax will be levied on every supply of goods and services. Centre would levy and collect Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST), and States would levy and collect the State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) on all transactions within a State. The input tax credit of CGST would be available for discharging the CGST liability on the output at each stage. Similarly, the credit of SGST paid on inputs would be allowed for paying the SGST on output. No cross utilization of credit would be permitted.\n \nHow would a particular transaction and services be taxed simultaneously under Central GST (CGST) and State GST (SGST)?\nThe Central GST and the State GST would be levied simultaneously on every transaction of supply of goods and services except on exempted goods and services, goods which are outside the purview of GST and the transactions which are below the prescribed threshold limits. Further, both would be levied on the same price or value unlike State VAT which is levied on the value of the goods inclusive of Central Excise.\n \nWill cross utilization of credits between goods and services be allowed under GST regime?\nCross utilization of credit of CGST between goods and services would be allowed. Similarly, the facility of cross utilization of credit will be available in case of SGST. However, the cross utilization of CGST and SGST would not be allowed except in the case of inter-State supply of goods and services under the IGST model .\n \nHow will be Inter-State Transactions of Goods and Services be taxed under GST in terms of IGST method?\nIn case of inter-State transactions, the Centre would levy and collect the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) on all inter-State supplies of goods and services under Article 269A (1) of the Constitution. The IGST would roughly be equal to CGST plus SGST. The IGST mechanism has been designed to ensure seamless Dual GST within State.\n \nHow will IT be used for the implementation of GST?\nFor the implementation of GST in the country, the Central and State Governments have jointly registered Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) as a not-for-profit, non-Government Company to provide shared IT infrastructure and services to Central and State Governments, tax payers and other stakeholders. The key objectives of GSTN are to provide a standard and uniform interface to the taxpayers, and shared infrastructure and services to Central and State/UT governments.\n\nGSTN is working on developing a state-of-the-art comprehensive IT infrastructure including the common GST portal providing frontend services of registration, returns and payments to all taxpayers, as well as the backend IT modules for certain States that include processing of returns, registrations, audits, assessments, appeals, etc. All States, accounting authorities, RBI and banks, are also preparing their IT infrastructure for the administration of GST. There would no manual filing of returns. All taxes can also be paid online. All mis-matched returns would be auto generated, and there would be no need for manual interventions. Most returns would be self-assessed.\n \n How will imports be taxed under GST?\nThe Additional Duty of Excise or CVD and the Special Additional Duty or SAD presently being levied on imports will be subsumed under GST. As per explanation to clause (1) of article 269A of the Constitution, IGST will be levied on all imports into the territory of India. Unlike in the present regime, the States where imported goods are consumed will now gain their share from this IGST paid on imported goods.\n \nWhat are the major features of the Constitution (122nd Amendment) Bill, 2014?\nThe salient features of the Bill are as follows:\n\n    Conferring simultaneous power upon Parliament and the State Legislatures to make laws governing goods and services tax\n    Subsuming of various Central indirect taxes and levies such as Central Excise Duty, Additional Excise Duties, Service Tax, Additional Customs Duty commonly known as Countervailing Duty, and Special Additional Duty of Customs\n    Subsuming of State Value Added Tax/Sales Tax, Entertainment Tax (other than the tax levied by the local bodies), Central Sales Tax (levied by the Centre and collected by the States), Octroi and Entry tax, Purchase Tax, Luxury tax, and Taxes on lottery, betting and gambling\n    Dispensing with the concept of ‘declared goods of special importance’ under the Constitution;\n    Levy of Integrated Goods and Services Tax on inter-State transactions of goods and services;\n    GST to be levied on all goods and services, except alcoholic liquor for human consumption. Petroleum and petroleum products shall be subject to the levy of GST on a later date notified on the recommendation of the Goods and Services Tax Council\n    Compensation to the States for loss of revenue arising on account of implementation of the Goods and Services Tax for a period of five years;\n    Creation of Goods and Services Tax Council to examine issues relating to goods and services tax and make recommendations to the Union and the States on parameters like rates, taxes, cesses and surcharges to be subsumed, exemption list and threshold limits, Model GST laws, etc. The Council shall function under the Chairmanship of the Union Finance Minister and will have all the State Governments as Members.\n\n \nWhat are the major features of the proposed registration procedures under GST?\nThe major features of the proposed registration procedures under GST are as follows:\n\n    Existing dealers: Existing VAT/Central excise/Service Tax payers will not have to apply afresh for registration under GST.\n    New dealers: Single application to be filed online for registration under GST.\n    The registration number will be PAN based and will serve the purpose for Centre and State.\n    Unified application to both tax authorities.\n    Each dealer to be given unique ID GSTIN.\n    Deemed approval within three days.\n    Post registration verification in risk based cases only.\n\n \nWhat are the major features of the proposed returns filing procedures under GST?\nThe major features of the proposed returns filing procedures under GST are as follows:\n\n    Common return would serve the purpose of both Centre and State Government.\n    There are eight forms provided for in the GST business processes for filing for returns. Most of the average tax payers would be using only four forms for filing their returns. These are return for supplies, return for purchases, monthly returns and annual return.\n    Small taxpayers: Small taxpayers who have opted composition scheme shall have to file return on quarterly basis.\n    Filing of returns shall be completely online. All taxes can also be paid online.\n\n \nWhat are the benefits of GST?\nThe benefits of GST can be summarized as under:\n\nFor business and industry\n\nEasy compliance: A robust and comprehensive IT system would be the foundation of the GST regime in India. Therefore, all tax payer services such as registrations, returns, payments, etc. would be available to the taxpayers online, which would make compliance easy and transparent.\n\nUniformity of tax rates and structures: GST will ensure that indirect tax rates and structures are common across the country, thereby increasing certainty and ease of doing business. In other words, GST would make doing business in the country tax neutral, irrespective of the choice of place of doing business.\n\nRemoval of cascading: A system of seamless tax-credits throughout the value-chain, and across boundaries of States, would ensure that there is minimal cascading of taxes. This would reduce hidden costs of doing business.\n\nImproved competitiveness: Reduction in transaction costs of doing business would eventually lead to an improved competitiveness for the trade and industry.\n\nGain to manufacturers and exporters: The subsuming of major Central and State taxes in GST, complete and comprehensive set-off of input goods and services and phasing out of Central Sales Tax (CST) would reduce the cost of locally manufactured goods and services. This will increase the competitiveness of Indian goods and services in the international market and give boost to Indian exports. The uniformity in tax rates and procedures across the country will also go a long way in reducing the compliance cost.\n \n \nFor Central and State Governments\nSimple and easy to administer: Multiple indirect taxes at the Central and State levels are being replaced by GST. Backed with a robust end-to-end IT system, GST would be simpler and easier to administer than all other indirect taxes of the Centre and State levied so far.\n\nBetter controls on leakage: GST will result in better tax compliance due to a robust IT infrastructure. Due to the seamless transfer of input tax credit from one stage to another in the chain of value addition, there is an inbuilt mechanism in the design of GST that would incentivize tax compliance by traders.\n\nHigher revenue efficiency: GST is expected to decrease the cost of collection of tax revenues of the Government, and will therefore, lead to higher revenue efficiency.\n\n \n For the consumer\n\nSingle and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services: Due to multiple indirect taxes being levied by the Centre and State, with incomplete or no input tax credits available at progressive stages of value addition, the cost of most goods and services in the country today are laden with many hidden taxes. Under GST, there would be only one tax from the manufacturer to the consumer, leading to transparency of taxes paid to the final consumer.\n\nRelief in overall tax burden: Because of efficiency gains and prevention of leakages, the overall tax burden on most commodities will come down, which will benefit.\n\n \nThese guides are not legal advice, nor a substitute for a lawyer\n\nThese articles are provided freely as general guides.

(4, 0, '7', 'A complete guide on filing income tax IT returns in India', 'What is Income Tax Return (ITR)?\nIncome tax return is a proof that you have an income for which you have paid tax. According to the Income Tax Act, 1961, the term ‘return of income’ means proof of income earned by an individual or a business entity. Filing of income tax returns (ITR) is a voluntary but mandatory obligation where you report your income, capitals gain, and other allowances and reliefs claimed for a particular year. It is mandatory for every person to file his ITR as per the taxation rates imposed by the government if his income exceeds the exempted tax bracket.\n \nWho is required to file Income Tax Return (ITR)?\nIndividuals\nAll those individuals whose annual income exceeds the basic exemption tab have to file ITR, you have to file your returns if you fall under any of the following categories.\n\n    Individuals (men and women both) with taxable income exceeding Rs 250,000 p.a.\n    Senior Citizens with taxable income exceeding Rs 300,000 p.a.\n    Senior citizens aged more than 80 years with taxable income exceeding Rs. 500,000 p.a.\n\n \nBusinesses\nCompanies, Partnerships, and Proprietorship: Income tax is calculated at a flat 30% on the total income of companies and firms.\n \nWhen to file your Income Tax Return (ITR)?\nThe due date for filing of IT returns is 31st of July every year after the financial year ending 31st March.\n \nWhy to file your Income Tax Return (ITR)?\n\n    Banks and High commissions of various countries, certain credit card companies insist on proof of tax return before extending you credit and issuing a card. The same goes for financial institutions, which may rely on ITRs of past few years before undertaking business transactions with you.\n    A good record of ITR can reflect strongly on your image as an individual and as a business when it comes to winning contracts and procuring high-profile projects. Sometimes, tender applications for large-scale infrastructure and other government projects are scrutinized based on the ITRs of past 5–7 years along with other factors.\n    In case of accidental death of an insured individual due to road accident, insurance claims are empowered by providing a clean record of ITR. Any missing returns can weaken the claim in case the insurance policy hits a disputed path. The Life insurance companies also ask for ITR documents against high-value policies.\n    ITRs are taken as a trusted yardstick by angel and seed investors and venture capitalists. Gaining visibility on your cash flows can become easy with a healthy tax record.\n    Short- or long-term capital losses, or losses of any other type incurred by an individual or a business can be recovered if they are accounted for in the tax return filed in that financial year.\n\n \nHow to file your Income tax return online?\n\n    Register yourself on the Income Tax Department''s website using your personal details. Your permanent account number (PAN) will be your user ID. \n    There are two ways of e-filing your income tax return. First, you can go to the download section and select the requisite form, save it on your desktop and fill all the details. Click on ''generate XML''. Then go to the website again and click on the ''upload XML'' button. You will have to first log into to upload the XML file saved on your desktop and click on submit. \n    You can go to the quick e-file section of the website. Log in and select the form and the assessment year for which you are filing return and fill in all the details. \n    Select the forms on the basis of the source of your income. In case of an individual with salary, pension income, income from one house property or income from other sources excluding lottery, you have to select Form ITR-1, also known as ''SAHAJ''. If you have capital gains, you will have to file Form ITR-2. \n    Keep a few documents such as your PAN number, Form 16, your interest statement, tax deducted at source (TDS) details and investments proves handy while e-filing your income tax return. \n     An additional column called "AL" has been added, in which you will have to disclose the value of your assets and liabilities at the end of the year, in case your income for the year is more than Rs 50 lakh. \n    You can also download your Form 26AS, which is your consolidated tax statement summarizing tax paid against your PAN. You can validate your tax return with Form 26AS to check you tax liability. \n    Once you are submitting the form, an acknowledgement number is generated in case the return is submitted using digital signature. If the return is submitted without a digital signature, an ITR-V is generated and is sent to your registered email ID. ITR-V is an acknowledgement that your return has been submitted. \n    You can also e-verify your return through electronic verification by using the e-verify return option on the website. You can also use the net banking, Aadhaar-based one-time password to e-verify it.\n\n \nThese guides are not legal advice, nor a substitute for a lawyer\n\nThese articles are provided freely as general guides.

(6, 0, '6', 'Laws on sexual harassment at workplace in India', 'Sexual Harassment at workplace: Myths and Verity\n\nSexual harassment is a type of prejudice based on sex primly attacking the modesty, dignity, obeisance of an individual. When someone is sexually harassed at the workplace it can affect the persona in many ways; it undermines the potential of a person to work and perform well at the workplace. Employers who do not take steps for prevention of sexual harassment at workplace can suffer major loss in the productivity of organization and suffer legal expenses if they are unable to fulfil the regulations prescribed under Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.\n\nWe have divided this article into various sections in order to provide ease of understanding to the reader about various complexities embargoed under Sexual Harassment Act. The article is divided under following categories-:\nA. Sexual Harassment\nB. Compliance under Sexual Harassment Act\n \nSexual Harassment\n\nSexual Harassment results in the violations of fundamental rights of women of equality under section 14 and 15 of the constitution of India and right to life and live with dignity under article 21 of the constitution of India and right to practice any profession, trade, business which includes a right to have a safe working environment.\n\nSexual harassment includes any unwelcome behavior or act of conduct of sexual in nature.\n \nTypes of Sexual Harassment at workplace\n\n(i) Quid Pro Que Sexual Harassment (This for That)\nWhen a designated senior puts a condition to a female employee to perform certain act which is unwished assuring her for a favor in return. This concept is basically called “This for that”.\n(ii) Hostile environment: Is created when an employee constantly and repeatedly do certain acts of sexual nature. \n\n    Sexual pranks, or repeated sexual teasing, jokes, in person or via e-mail; \n    A demand or request of sexual favor; \n    Asking for Verbal or Non Verbal advances; \n    Touching or grabbing; etc. \n     \n\nCompliance Under Sexual Harassment Act\n\nThere are various compliance requirements which need to be adhered to by an organization. Without going into the details, the bullet requirements to be complied under the Sexual Harassment Act is as follows-:\n\n(i) Drafting and implementation of Sexual Harassment Policy-: The organization needs to carefully draft a sexual harassment policy which should cover the basic points such as-:\n\n    ICC Composition: names, designation and contact details of the ICC members.\n    What constitutes as a sexual harassment act like verbal, physical, quid pro qou etc.\n\nThe policy should include the procedure for Resolution, Settlement, Prosecution, enquiry and trial procedure to deal with  \n\n(ii) Amendment to the Employment agreements-: What organization fails to do is to amend their employment agreements to be in tune with the SH policy. This is also an important aspect as the employee signs the obligations under the employment agreement at the time of joining. \n\n(iii) Formation of Internal Complaints Committee (“ICC”)-: This is one of the prime duties for an employer to adhere to the following conditions. The composition of the ICC should constitute of a female “Presiding Officer” at prominent designation, (ii) two members who have legal knowledge and have had experience in social work, (iii) one person who is familiar with the sexual harassment issues or a person from NGO, (iv) it is required that more than 50% of the members are females in the committee.  \n\n(iv) Sensitization of the ICC and Employees-: This is one of the key factors to be adhered to by the organization for the prevention of Sexual Harassment at workplace.\nSensitizing the employees (both males and females) about sexual harassment, that constitutes sexual harassment and repercussion thereof.\nOrientation programmers or seminars for the member of the internal committee\nInvolve females in the workshops to make the workshop more effective and include case studies for better understanding.\nEstablish a better security system in the office. For eg, cameras in the cabins and corridors. \n\n(vi) Filling of Annual Report by ICC -: The organizations are required to file reports providing various information such as-: The ICC shall prepare annual report under section 21: (i) number of sexual harassment complaints received in a year; (ii) number of complaints disposed of in a year; (iii) number of cases pending for more than 90 days; (iv) number of awareness programs or workshops against sexual harassment conducted in a year; (v) nature of action taken by the employer or district officer; and (vi) where no such report is required to be prepared, intimate such number of cases, if any, to the District Officer. (As per section 22 of Sexual Harassment Act) \n \nConclusion\n\nAn increasing trend of complaints of sexual harassment at work places shows the increasing awareness. The main objective of Act is to ensure safe and secure environment to every women, irrespective of her age, employment status, freedom from all forms of sexual harassment by making the employer responsible for the same. Cases like TERI, Tehalka have set an example that how such eminent organizations faces loss of reputation if not complying with Sexual Harassment Act. The punishment prescribed for non-compliance under the Sexual Harassment Act is fine upto Rs. 1,00,000/- or cancellation of license to carry out the business/service by the organization, which might ultimately lead to defamation; attacking the name and goodwill of the organization. As a learned person has quoted that “it takes years to build reputation, but a moment to lose it”', '', 1, '2017-07-13 13:09:17', '2017-07-13 13:09:17'),

Short title and extent –\n\n(1) This Act may be called the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939.\n\n (2) It extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n State Amendment\n\n Pondicherry.—In section 1, after sub-section (2), add the following:—\n\n “Provided that nothing contained in this Act shall apply to Renoncants of the Union territory of Pondicherry”, vide the Pondicherry (Extension of Laws) Act, 1968, sec. 3 and Sch.\n\n ———————–\n\n1. Subs. by the Adaptation of Laws (No. 3) Order, 1956, for “Part B States”.\n\n2.Subs. by Act 48 of 1959 sec. 3 and Sch. I, for certain words (w.e.f. 1-2-1960).\n \n2. Grounds for decree for dissolution of marriage.-\n\nA woman married under Muslim law shall be entitled to obtain a decree for the dissolution of her marriage on any one or more of the following grounds, namely:—\n\n (i) that the whereabouts of the husband have not been known for a period of four years;\n\n (ii) that the husband has neglected or has failed to provide for her maintenance for a period of two years;\n\n (iii) that the husband has been sentenced to imprisonment for a period of seven years or upwards;\n\n (iv) that the husband has failed to perform, without reasonable cause, his marital obligations for a period of three years;\n\n(v) that the husband was impotent at the time of the marriage and continues to be so;\n\n (vi) that the husband has been insane for a period of two years or is suffering from leprosy or virulent venereal disease;\n\n(vii) that she, having been given in marriage by her father or other guardian before she attained the age of fifteen years, repudiated the marriage before attaining the age of eighteen years:\n\n Provided that the marriage has not been consummated;\n\n (viii) that the husband treats her with cruelty, that is to say,—\n\n (a) habitually assaults her or makes her life miserable by cruelty of conduct even if such conduct does not amount to physical ill-treatment, or\n\n (b) associates with women of evil repute or leads an infamous life, or\n\n (c) attempts to force her to lead an immoral life, or\n\n (d) disposes of her property or prevents her exercising her legal rights over it, or\n\n (e) obstructs her in the observance of her religious profession or practice, or\n\n (f) if he has more wives than one, does not treat her equitably in accordance with the injunctions of the Quran;\n\n (ix) on any other ground which is recognised as valid for the dissolution of marriages under Muslim law:\n\n Provided that—\n\n(a) no decree shall be passed on ground (iii) until the sentence has become final;\n\n (b) a decree passed on ground (i) shall not take effect for a period of six months from the date of such decree, and if the husband appears either in person or through an authorised agent within that period and satisfies the Court that he is prepared to perform his conjugal duties, the Court shall set aside the said decree; and\n\n (c) before passing a decree on ground (v) the Court shall, on application by the husband, make an order requiring the husband to satisfy the Court within a period of one year from the date of such order that he has ceased to be impotent, and if the husband so satisfies the Court within such period, no decree shall be passed on the said ground.\n\nComments\n\nCruelty\n\n(i) A wife filed an application for divorce on the ground of cruelty and non-performance of marital obligations by the husband. Thereafter both the husband and wife filed a joint application for divorce by mutual consent. Held, grounds for divorce under the section were already met out so decree of divorce can be passed in terms of the compromise between the parties even in the absence of a provision of divorce by consent under the Act, more so when the husband has already married and the wife’s marriage was also fixed up; Md. Abdul Zalil Ahmed v. Marina Begum, AIR 1999 Gau 28.\n\n (ii) If the husband, after taking a second wife against the wishes of the first, also wants the assistance of the Civil Court to compel the first to live with him, the Court will respect the sanctity of the second marriage but it will not compel the first wife, against her wishes, to live with the husband under the altered circumstances and share his consortium with another woman if it concludes, on a reivew of the evidence, that it will be inequitable to comple her to do so; Itwari v. Asghani, AIR 1960 All 684.\n\n Impotency\n\nOn a wife’s petition for dissolution of marriage on the ground of husband’s impotency, the husband sought a year’s time to prove that he had ceased to be impotent. On the expiry of one year the decree was granted on the wife’s application. The husband’s contention that during the one year period he was denied the company of his wife was negatived. Held, the Act requires an opportunity to satisfy the court about cessation of impotency and that opportunity is available only when husband makes an application for the same. It would not be right to say that subsequent acquisition of virility can be proved only by sexual act with the wife which would mean that she should make herself available to the husband again and again whenever demand during the entire period of the year. Such interpretation which subjects the wife to this queer predicament cannot be sound, according to the court; Abdul Azeem v. Fathimunnisa Begum, AIR 1969 Mys 226.\n\n Option of puberty\n\n(i) Any thing done by the minor during the minority would not destroy the right which could accrue only after puberty. The cohabitation of a minor girl would not thus put an end to the option to repudiate the marriage after puberty. The assent should come after puberty and not before, for the simple reason that the minor is incompetent to contract, nor should the consummation have taken place without her consent; Ghulam Lakina v. Falak Sha Allah Baksh, AIR 1950 Lah 45.\n\n(ii) A muslim woman, under section 2(ii) of the dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939, can sue for dissolution on the score that she has not as a fact been maintained even if there is good cause for it, the voice of the law, echoing public policy is often that of the realist, not of the moralist; A. Yusuf v. Sowramma, AIR 1971 Ker 261.\n \n3. Notice to be served on heirs of the husband when the husband’s whereabouts are not known.-\n\nIn a suit to which clause (I) of section 2 applies,-\n\n(a) the names and addresses of the persons who would have been the heirs of the husband under Muslim law if he had died on the date of the filing of the plaint shall be stated in the plaint,\n\n(b) notice of the suit shall be served on such persons, and\n\n (c) such persons shall have the right to be heard in the suit:\n\n Provided that paternal uncle and brother of the husband, if any, shall be cited as party even if he or they are not heirs.\n \n 4. Effect of conversion to another faith.-\n\nThe renunciation of Islam by a married Muslim woman or her conversion to a faith other than Islam shall not be itself operate to dissolve her marriage:\n\n Provided that after such renunciation, or conversion the woman shall be entitled to obtain a decree for the dissolution of her marriage on any of the grounds mentioned, in section 2:\n\n Provided further that the provisions of this section shall not apply to a woman converted to Islam from some other faith who re-embraces her former faith.\n \n5. Rights to dower not to be affected.-\n\nNothing contained in this Act shall affect any right which a married woman may have under Muslim law to her dower or any part thereof on the dissolution of her marriage.\n\n \nThese guides are not legal advice, nor a substitute for a lawyer\n\nThese articles are provided freely as general guides.
